# Task 7 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This project trains an SVM model using both linear and RBF kernels on the Breast Cancer dataset.

## Steps:
- Load and preprocess dataset
- Train SVM with linear and RBF kernels
- Visualize decision boundary (2D)
- Evaluate using accuracy and classification report
